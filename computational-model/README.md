# Computational model for paper XXX

Simulations were done with **NEURON** https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
using Python.

## Channels models

Channels were defined using NEURON's Channel Builder 

https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/chanlbild/main.html

All channels are saved in a single session file, and can be found in [neuron-model](neuron-model)

| File           | Description | 
| ---------------    | ----------- | 
| `ch_carter_subtchan.ses`  |  Deterministic channels |
| `stch_carter_subtchan.ses`  |  Stochastic channels |
